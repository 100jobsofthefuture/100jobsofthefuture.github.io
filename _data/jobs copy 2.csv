Automated transit system troubleshooter,Automated transit system troubleshooters will address potential problems that occur in a transit system almost entirely comprised of autonomous self driving vehicles.,"These days, most of the vehicles on the roads drive themselves. The passengers in those cars get on with work, leisure activities, or even sleep while the car takes them where they need to go. These autonomous cars have many sensors on them, and they are networked together. They communicate with one another about their position, speed, the traffic conditions, hazards, and other environmental conditions. Traffic lights don’t exist anymore, as an automated transit management system ensures that everything runs smoothly and efficiently. The transit management system also makes sure that accidents don’t happen and everyone stays safe.
However, occasionally things go wrong that the automated systems can’t correct. Robots can easily deal with a single autonomous car breakdown — within two minutes they clear the car off the road and bring a replacement vehicle for the passengers. But they have more trouble dealing with the occasional human-driven old car, who may break the road rules and behave erratically. Sometimes hackers will break into a traffic management system and cause chaos. Very occasionally, an extreme weather event that wasn’t anticipated by the climate modifiers can bring everything to a standstill.
When things go wrong with the transit management system, the Automated Transit System Troubleshooter steps in.
They use monitoring systems and sensors to tell them what has gone wrong, and make rapid decisions about the best way to fix the problem. They may use digital algorithms to help them predict the consequences of different courses of action, and robotic or human workers to clear obstacles to traffic flow and get cars moving again.
They may also draw upon the expertise of an ethical hacker or cybersecurity personnel to repair the systems damage caused by malicious attacks.
Automated Transit System Troubleshooters will be decisive and quick thinking. They will be able to make sense of multiple sources of data in order to inform decisions. They will be effective risk managers, and competent using digital technologies. They will be clear communicators.

For instance, a community area contains environmental sensors that pick up information about its residents, the environment, energy use, and patterns of consumption. The community employs a data commodities broker to negotiate the sale of this data. Data Commodities Brokers will have a background in sales or commerce, with specific interests in financial and data management. They will have strong maths, logic and problem-solving skills, and have data-based research capabilities to understand the market demand for a particular type of data. They will work with algorithmic software to undertake projections. They will have solid negotiating skills, and an understanding of data law.","AOW2, AOW18","E, I, C",data,,new
Data farmer,Data farmers will create and manage semi-autonomous algorithms that will identify and trace connections between otherwise unrelated sets of data.,"Reminiscent of the gold farmers of early online games and the bitcoin miners of the early 21st century, these bulk data analysts called Data Farmers create and wrangle semi-autonomous algorithms that identify and trace connections between otherwise unrelated sets of data.
Part accountant, part detective, part service worker, Data Farmers ‘milk’ their algorithms regularly to extract meaningful extrapolations from stochastic data comparisons. They then pass what they’ve learned on to businesses, community co-ordinators, and government agencies to predict trends that can be used for new products and services, regulation of commerce, and community/environmental strategies.
Data Farmers will have good programming and algorithmic design skills. They will be creative and have cognitive flexibility to combine or group data in different ways, and to identify the connections between them. They will be good problem-solvers and have excellent analytical skills. Many Data Farmers working in industry will need to be quite entrepreneurial, as they will often be freelance, or employed by small to medium enterprises. They will need to pitch to businesses and sell the meaningful connections and predictions that they’ve identified.","AOW12, AOW17, AOW18","I, C, E",data,,new

About 230 of these are just about food! In the future, people will all have virtual assistants that use recommender systems (based on machine learning algorithms) to help them make decisions. If the person has been working with a personal brand and content manager, a health shaper, a psychologist or a personal nutrition specialist, they may well make changes to the recommender system’s algorithms to help the person make better decisions. However, sometimes automated decision support systems go wrong, or aren’t able to help with decisions because there isn’t enough of the right data available. Sometimes, people need to make very big decisions with significant potential repercussions, and prefer to work with a human to make sure the choice they are making is the appropriate one. Decision Support Workers will listen to the needs of their clients, pull together additional helpful data that the client may not have access to, and make sense of it all to help with decision- making (with the help of algorithmic tools).

De-extinction geneticist,"De-extinction geneticists will restore extinct animal and plant species, in order to rebalance ecosystems, improve agriculture, and create designer pets.","During the early Anthropocene (the geological period during which human activity started to be the dominant influence on climate and the environment, before ecology restoration began), many species of animals and plants became extinct.
About 40% of bird species, 30% of amphibians, and 55% of insect species disappeared during this time.
Thankfully, governments realised the importance of healthy environments, and ecology restoration became a priority activity globally.
Most De-extinction and Conservation Geneticists work with ecology restoration workers to rebalance ecosystems. Some work in agriculture. However, some De-extinction and Conservation Geneticists work in novelty areas, bringing dinosaurs, aurochs, Tasmanian tigers and woolly mammoths back to life for wealthy people who want to own them as pets. This is a controversial area of de-extinction genetics, as reintroduction of extinct animals and plants can lead to harm to modern species, and cause imbalance in ecosystems.
