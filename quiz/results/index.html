      While these jobs have been suggested to you based on your quiz answers, it’s important to remember that this is not a complete list of all the things you might like or could do. Use these jobs as inspiration for finding out more!
      Remember, these are jobs that are different to those that currently exist. There are other jobs today that may continue relatively unchanged into the near future but are not listed in these ‘future jobs’. Perhaps the job you really want is one
      of those! Good luck!</p>

<h2>How can I find out more?</h2>
<p>Now that you have a sense of the type of work that might suit your career interests, it’s a good idea to explore further. By learning more about different future jobs, you have a chance to try things out, decide if they are for you, and get a head
  start in building skills and experiences that will be useful later on.</p>
<p>You can find out more about the skills and experience that might be useful by reviewing the jobs you’re interested in and thinking about what sort of things you’d be likely to do in those jobs. What skills or experiences would you be likely to
  need? Do these jobs involve working with a particular group of people, doing a particular task, or using a particular technology? </p>
<p>You can also search online for jobs that are in similar fields or doing similar things. For example, by looking at job ads, and just general googling you can build up a good picture of the skills, knowledge and experience that will be useful in
  these roles. Then, you can explore ways to learn these skills and build up some experience, as a taster.</p>

<h2>Building on your strengths</h2>
<p>When you’re exploring what’s out there, it helps to work with your strengths and preferences. The quiz identified some of your career preferences, and it makes sense to work with those preferences. Don’t feel that you’re limited to only working
  within your style though!</p>
<ul>
  <li>Practical: If you scored highest in the Practical category, you might prefer to dive in and try new things. Practical experiences might be the most useful way for you to learn new skills and see if you like the areas you’re exploring. Try
    volunteering, teaching yourself some new skills or techniques – just have a go!</li>
  <li>Investigative: If you scored highest in the Investigative category, you might prefer to research privately online before you try anything practical. For Investigative people, online research is your friend! You might find that you can learn the
    most from researching trends independently.</li>
  <li>Creative: If you scored highest in the Creative category, you might find the idea of having a plan for exploring your options is too rigid. Feel free to go where the wind takes you! If you find an interesting tangent when you’re exploring your
    options, then dive in and learn more about it! You might also find that you prefer to get a group of friends together and try things out as a group, rather than going solo.</li>
  <li>Social: If you scored highest in the Social category, you might find that you’ll have a better time exploring your options in contact with other people. You could look into learning new skills or gaining new knowledge with a group of friends
    (why not get them to take the quiz too?) or perhaps join a club or society, where you can learn through interacting with other people. You might find that you get a lot out of volunteering, or by talking to people with relevant skills or
    experience.</li>
  <li>Enterprising: If you scored highest in the Enterprising category, you might prefer to build your skills in a way that lets you see how much progress you’ve made. This can be as simple as tracking new knowledge, or doing more formal learning
    that has ‘grades’ or ‘levels’ to progress through. You might be interested in identifying the top people and companies in your field, and using their journeys as inspiration for your own. You may also enjoy exploring your options through talking
    to people who know about these areas or have relevant skills or experience.</li>
  <li>Organised: If you scored highest in the Organised category, you might prefer a methodical approach to exploring your options. Take the time to create a plan (and clear goals!) for how you’re going to approach things, and keep note of how your
    progress goes. You might seek out established clubs, societies or organisations, or people that can help you learn new skills, rather than going it alone.</li>
